Take 3 of me creating a React, PostgreSQL, and Spring Boot Application.

[Tutorial that I am following](https://www.bezkoder.com/spring-boot-react-postgresql/)

Currently at "Create Repository Interface" section

You're at Maven 3.9.6. You had to unlink from Maven 3.9.11. If you want to go back to Maven 3.9.11, run the following command:
```brew unlink maven@3.9.6 && brew link maven```

If you want to run the backend, run this command in the be/ folder:
```mvn spring-boot:run```
