[Following this guide to build a React, Spring Boot, and PostgreSQL app (you're also going to add in Tailwind CSS)](https://dev.to/mspilari/fullstack-app-building-the-front-end-with-vite-react-typescript-hooks-and-docker-3i63)

This app is intended to be an Amazon clone called Yippieazon. Everytime you add an item to your cart, you get a "Yippie!" sound effect. Everytime you remove an item from your cart, you get an "Oh no!" sound effect.

The tech stack for this application will be:
 React and Vite for the Frontend.
 Spring Boot for the Backend. [NOT ADDED YET]
 PostgreSQL for the Database. [NOT ADDED YET]
 Tailwind CSS for styling. [NOT ADDED YET]
 React-Router for routing assistance. [NOT ADDED YET]
 Docker for containerization and hosting. [NOT ADDED YET]

Code to run the fe/ folder frontend:
```npm run dev```
